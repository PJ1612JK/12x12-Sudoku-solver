# 12x12-Sudoku-solver
A small python program to solve 12x12 sudoku puzzles.

Takes the puzzle as a numpy array and solves it via recursion.

To use the program, fun the file and then call the function solver(). If it does not work well from your IDE of choice then try running it directly from the terminal.

Feel free to tinker with it
